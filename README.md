        my $countryshort = $obj->get_country_short("20.11.187.239");
        my $countrylong  = $obj->get_country_long("20.11.187.239");

# DESCRIPTION

This module is a lightweight version of Geo::IP2Location that is compatible
with **IPv4** BIN files only. It fixes all the current issues against the
current version of Geo::IP2Location and makes the perl more idiomatic (and
thus easier to maintain). The code is also compatible with older perls
([Geo::IP2Location](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo::IP2Location) currently only works with 5.14 and above).

You should see the documentation for the original [Geo::IP2Location](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo::IP2Location) module
for a complete list of available methods, the documentation below includes
**additional** methods addded by this module only.

# DIFFERENCES FROM [Geo::IP2Location](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo::IP2Location)

The get\_country method has been added to get both short and long in one call:

        my ( $country_short,$country_long ) = $obj->get_country( $ip );

The ISO-3166 code for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has
been corrected from **UK** to **GB**
